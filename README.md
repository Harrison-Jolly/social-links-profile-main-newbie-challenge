## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project taught me that to vertically center text inside an anchor tag set the line height of the text to be the same height as the anchor tag.

```css
a {
    width: 85%;
    height: 40px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 0.5rem auto;
    text-decoration: none;
    text-align: center;
    line-height: 40px;
    font-weight: 700;
    font-size: 1rem;
    transition: ease-in-out 500ms;;
}
```
